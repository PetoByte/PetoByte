# Welcome!
Welcome to the source code repository of the PetoByte Micro:Bit project.

# About
We started when founder Graham T. and Milo I. started working on this as a school project and it soon became a free time thing.
We now have open-sourced the software so anyone can do anythign they want with it as long as it complies with our license they can also download the hex file and upload it onto their own Micro:Bit!
Find a freind with a Micro:Bit and tell them how to install it so your PetoByte machines can play together, or just buy a second Micro:Bit.

# Install
1. Download the [.hex file](https://github.com/PetoByte/PetoByte/blob/main/PetoByte.hex). (which is updated frequently.)
2. Connect and pair your Micro:Bit so you can upload the .hex file.
3. Copy the .hex file into your Micro:Bit's file system.
